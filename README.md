Identifying Food Deserts in Los Angeles
PROJECT NAME
Identifying Food Deserts in Los Angeles
DESCRIPTION
The official USDA definition of a food desert is an area that lacks a grocery store. This is just one definition, and it fails to take into account other social and economic issues that limit access to healthy food. Using data from the city of Los Angeles' data portal, we should be able to identify food deserts based on grocery store locations and demographic data for the area. Under a baseline definition, we would be looking for areas where there is no grocery store within 10-15 minutes of a low income area. Stretch goals for the project would be to identify other socioeconomic versions of a food desert (such as grocery stores in the low income areas being high cost, broken down by sex/race/etc.) and creating interactive visualizations for the project. Additional stretch would be to expand to include LA county (but there data portal is not as rich) or another large city with open data like New York.
